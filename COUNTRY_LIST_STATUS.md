# Country List Implementation Status

## 🔍 **Current Investigation**

The country list with flags, exchanges, and IPO counts is already implemented in the code (lines 400-456 in Home.py) but may not be displaying properly in the browser.

## ✅ **Code Implementation Confirmed**

The country list feature includes:
- Country flags mapping for all major countries
- Regional classification (APAC, EMEA, Americas)
- IPO counts per country
- Average performance metrics
- Total market cap per country
- Exchange listings
- Professional styling with gradient backgrounds

## 📊 **Expected Display**

The country list should show:
- Three-column layout with country cards
- Flag emoji + country name
- Region classification
- Number of IPOs
- Performance percentage
- Market capitalization
- Exchange names

## 🔧 **Current Status**

The code is implemented but the country list section may not be visible in the current browser view. Need to:
1. Scroll further down to find the country list section
2. Check if there are any rendering issues
3. Verify the section is being called correctly in the main flow

## 📍 **Location in Code**

The country list is implemented in Home.py starting at line 400 with the country summary generation and display logic.
