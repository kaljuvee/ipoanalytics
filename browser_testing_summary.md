The application loads efficiently with appropriate progress indicators during data refresh operations.

#### Memory Usage ‚úÖ
The enhanced global data fetcher demonstrates efficient memory management with parallel processing and proper resource cleanup.

#### Scalability ‚úÖ
The system handles the expanded global dataset effectively with configurable limits and batch processing capabilities.

### User Experience Assessment

#### Navigation ‚úÖ
The interface provides intuitive navigation with clear section organization and responsive filter controls.

#### Visual Design ‚úÖ
The professional design maintains consistency with proper color coding, typography, and layout structure across all components.

#### Information Architecture ‚úÖ
